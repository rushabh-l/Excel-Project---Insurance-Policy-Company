1. Data Overview : Understand the structure and contents of the dataset.
2. Descriptive Statistics : Summarize key statistics for numerical fields.Calculate measures like mean, median, mode, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation for:age,bmi,charges using various excel formulas
3. Missing Values and Data Integrity : Check for missing, inconsistent, or outlier values. Excel Formula: =COUNTBLANK(range)
4. Categorical Data Analysis : Understand the distribution of categorical variables.
5. Grouped Analysis : Identify trends within groups. Compare : Average charges by sex, Average charges by smoker status, Average charges and BMI by region.
6. Aggregated Metrics : Summarize data across key dimensions. Calculate: Average medical costs by region, Average BMI by sex, Total dependents per region.

By performing these EDA steps, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and uncover actionable insights for further analysis.

a) After performing after EDA, I dive into the 10 business questions provided to me.
b) These questions provided a clear idea and picture about the dataset and the problems evolved.
c) Solved all the business question by doing some advanced excel knowledge like pivit table, power pivot, excel functions, etc which help in  preparing a interactive and dynamic dashboard for business purpose.
d) Dashboard includes some of the bar charts, column charts, pie charts, key metrics, KPI's, filters/slicers, etc,
e )By going through the dataset cleaning, modelling, visualization, dasboard has been prepared by me.

Which will help the stakeholders to play with the insights based upon the various metrics included in dashboard and derive actionable insights for cost optimization and policy planning

Overall Strategic Recommendations :
Preventive Care Programs: Focus on reducing risk factors (e.g., smoking, high BMI) through education and incentives.
Regional Strategies: Customize healthcare and cost-management strategies based on regional trends.
Family-Centric Plans: Enhance plans targeting beneficiaries with dependents to optimize utilization and reduce costs.
Chronic Disease Management: Implement targeted programs for high-cost outliers to mitigate long-term expenses.
Data-Driven Decision Making: Use dashboards to identify emerging trends and respond proactively to healthcare challenges.

By implementing these insights and recommendations, health insurers can optimize medical costs, improve beneficiary outcomes, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.
